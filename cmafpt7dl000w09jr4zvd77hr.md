Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) was introduced in 2006 with .NET Framework 3.0. Fast-forward to 2025, and some developers are surprised to hear it’s still in active use.

So the big question is: is WPF dead? Or is it quietly powering enterprise-grade desktop software behind the scenes?

The truth is more nuanced than a yes/no answer — let’s break it down.

# **🧠 What is WPF at its Core?**

WPF is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. It uses:

* XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) for UI design
    
* C# or [VB.NET](http://VB.NET) for logic
    
* MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is the primary design pattern
    
* It offers vector-based rendering, data binding, animation, styles/templates, and custom controls — all natively supported by Windows.
    

# **🧨 Why WPF is “Dead” — According to the Internet**

* Microsoft is pushing MAUI and Winui
    
* Lack of cross-platform support
    
* Minimal updates to the tooling/UI designer in Visual Studio
    
* The trend toward web-first or Electron apps, **But here’s the kicker:** most of those reasons apply to startups or cross-platform-focused teams, not to Windows-first enterprise environments.
    

# **🛠 Why WPF is Still Alive (and Used) in 2025**

✅ 1. Massive Enterprise Codebases  
There are thousands of legacy WPF apps in the finance, manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare industries. Rewriting them into MAUI/Blazor isn’t just time-consuming — it’s often unnecessary.

✅ 2. Performance for Heavy UI  
Do you need a high-performance UI with real-time data, charts, dashboards, and hardware integration? WPF still handles that better than most modern web stacks.

✅ 3. Mature Ecosystem  
WPF is well-supported and production-ready, from third-party libraries like DevExpress, Telerik, and Syncfusion to open-source options.

✅ 4. Integration with .net 8  
Since .net Core 3.0, WPF has been open-sourced and supported in the .net SDK ecosystem. It’s no longer tied to just the full.net Framework. It runs smoothly with .net 6/7/8 LTS, and that’s a big deal for modernisation.

# **📈 When Should You Still Use WPF?**

Choose WPF if:

You’re building a Windows-only tool for internal enterprise use

You want deep control over the UI/UX and rendering performance.

You’re working on POS, medical, or industrial apps

You’re maintaining or upgrading an existing WPF codebase

You need a multi-monitor, touch screen, or hardware input support.

# **🚫 When You Should Avoid WPF**

Don’t go with WPF if:

You need cross-platform desktop + mobile support → Use .net MAUI or Electron + Blazor

You’re targeting a browser → Use Blazor, React, or Vue.

You’re building consumer-grade, modern-looking apps with web-style flexibility.y

# **💡 Personal Insight**

As someone who’s worked on Flutter, Electron, and WinForms, I still find WPF powerful for specific kinds of apps. It’s not dead; it’s just not cool anymore. But in the enterprise world, cool doesn’t matter — stability does.
