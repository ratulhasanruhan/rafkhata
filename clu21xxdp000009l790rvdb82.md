**Important things about Flutter package development.**

Simply create a flutter project. But set the Project Type to package.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQHTluZEwhAm8Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1711072046054?e=1716422400&v=beta&t=6yNkg0pR3asQy3MAt76NfbCpVcYYstBGTbDjQoMDP4M align="left")

Android Studio =&gt; New Flutter Project

**\*\*\***

And the project will be created. Here don't have any Android, iOS or other folders. Make a **src** directory for all files and a \[package\_name\].dart inside the lib folder. Also, make an **Example** folder. Inside the example folder make a new Flutter **application** (not package) for the example app.

Inside the \[package\_name\].dart addyour file name and most importantly add

a library declaration. Like this:-

Write **readme.md** file instruction is given inside the file. Record a short video of your project and convert it to .gif. And set it to readme file. It will be more professional.

Write CHANGELOG as .md method. You can follow this method -

```markdown
## 1.0.0

* Initial release

## 1.0.1

* add example

## 1.0.2

* some minor changes
```

Edit the license file. Flutter recommend this [https://opensource.org/license/BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/license/BSD-3-Clause) .

```makefile

Add your project to GitHub.

Then the most important thing. Add data for the [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/).

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQF8MD8Z9CAkqg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1711073618831?e=1716422400&v=beta&t=2I_huAk-uOqw5G-RtkTdpPSM16BhsColM8iJiLleq5I align="left")

Optional thing but If you add those. It will be more professional.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQGAwQgvprxHog/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1711073727266?e=1716422400&v=beta&t=DJUXJ3ReAJv3WYT_nBKbEfdGSnto07d5XzEvNrKPTwQ align="left")

Optional

Now, a most important thing. You have to add platforms: on pubspec.yaml otherwise it shows undefined platform on [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/).

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQE-GvoSNs7Lpw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1711073942848?e=1716422400&v=beta&t=5jtqD8-NX9PERmmMNjbpbhUr8qe8CL0A68n_kteKb5E align="left")

Most important for show this:

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQFfQA_UiboY-w/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1711074174888?e=1716422400&v=beta&t=wyDArULY2HykbIUP4Mpa8bSbDUZbSpynG7i32nlHElY align="left")

---

For a better view of [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/) . Like this-

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQHFESZW9MVbeg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1711074016543?e=1716422400&v=beta&t=y68-L074B09tbV1k6nFZdEjDcx_uJhiHnTfGos6i9QI align="left")

Just add this on pubspec.yaml. And put your screenshot on it.

```yaml
screenshots:
  - description: "Example of first page"
    path: example/screenshot/screenshot1.png
  - description: "Example of middle page"
    path: example/screenshot/screenshot2.png
  - description: "Example of final page"
    path: example/screenshot/screenshot3.png
```

---

Now the publishing part:

You can create a publisher account (optional). Login with Google on [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/) .

Now on the project terminal write this command -

```bash
dart pub publish
```

And Done!!

Thanks for reading this whole bunch of things.
